        This site is build on responsive principle. Elements resize according to the browser window size to ensure 
        that user will be able to view all the information more effectively.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some CSS3 properties that are used on this site are flexbox and animation. The animation is used for a loader 
        located just on top of the navigation menu on the bottom of the page, but since 
        the page will most likely load very fast, you wil not be able to see the loader. However, you are able to see the loader 
        by clicking the button below.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center">
        <a id="displayLoaderBtn" class="hexagonal-button" href="#">Show Loader</a>
    </p>

        All styles are written on a SASS file, which are compiled into a regular CSS file. <i>Normalize.css</i> is used 
        to normalize browser-specific behaviors.
